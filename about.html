<a href="https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=7f14bd60-9d13-4822-b130-55d4cdab7e0c&cp=17.119921~121.605613&lvl=14.5&pi=0&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027">Isabela State University-Roxas Campus</a>,<br>
BSIT Major in NS. She's a committed student that adores learning new things and practising the discipline of writing poetry.<br>
Her days are devoted to learning as she enthusiastically assimilate knowledge on a variety of topics. Her inquisitive nature<br>
drives her ahead on this academic path whether she delving into the complexities of science orprobing the nuanced aspects of history.<br>
<p>
But somewhere inside of her, buried beneath the pressures of academia, is a passionate poet. She find comfort in the cadence and<br>
rhythm of verses as the sun is setting and everything around me is calm. She tried to capture transient feelings, create vivid mental<br>
landscapes, and solve the puzzles  of the human experience<br>through my poems. Each poem is a canvas where she blend her thoughts,<br>
dreams, and musings, hoping to leave an indelible impression on anyone who stumbles upon her<br> verses.<br>
<P>
So, you could say she lead a dual life â€“ one where she absorbed in textbooks and lectures, and another where she transported to a<br>
realm of metaphors and metaphysics.<br> Balancing these two passions allows her to explore the world with a multifaceted perspective,<br>
one that values both the concrete and the abstract,<br>the analytical and the creative.
